                My name is <span class="u-highlight">Ryan English</span>, and I am a self taught <span class="u-highlight">software engineer</span> and graduate of the University of Louisville School of Business.
                I specialize in building business applications to fit the specific needs of the end users. My primary focus is .NET; but always find
                myself learning and utilizing new technologies to tackle new problems.
                My passion is solving challenging problems.

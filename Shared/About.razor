                My name is Ryan English, and I am a self taught software engineer based out of <span class="u-highlight">Louisville</span>. I specialize in building business applications to fit the specific needs of the end users. My primary focus is .NET, but learning, utilizing, and implementing new techniques and technologies will always be my passion.

                Outside of my profession, I also have interests in game development, table tennis, hiking, and music (who doesn't?). 
                I enthusiastically enjoy 
                <span class="u-highlight">the Supermen Lovers</span>, <span class="u-highlight">Trivium</span>, <span class="u-highlight">Denzel Curry</span>, 
                and <span class="u-highlight">SOS Band</span>.
